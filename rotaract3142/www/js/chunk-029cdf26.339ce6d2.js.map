The surveys garnered over 98 responses from potential participants, about 70% of which were willing to talk about their mental issues. The form for booking appointments was circulated regularly to get noticed by people in need of such sessions. Appointment confirmation messages were sent to the people two days prior to their appointments. A total of 2 sessions per day were conducted for 30 days, of around 60 minutes duration per session via Zoom Meetings App. A total of 60 participants attended and every participant was grateful and satisfied after their sessions. \",\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            proj:\"Rangeela - Canvas for a Cause\",\r\n            club:\"Rotaract Club of Thane North End\",\r\n            content:\"Sometimes all you need to do is let your creative fuel outburst and witness yourself creating a thing that the entire community loves to see.

In all total 19 teams had applied and 8 shortlisted projects were executed thereby giving the GBMs an opportunity to take charge of things. In Phase 2, orientation was conducted of all the GBMs and new members, where they were taught about all the avenues, their roles, and responsibilities. In Phase 3, the new members had applied for a core position for the upcoming year and they went through a rigorous screening process, right from group discussion, aptitude test, real-time understanding, Rotaract knowledge to drilling in the interview by an experienced panel.

Under this project, we had asked all the participants to send a video showcasing their talent and give a quick tutorial for the audience to learn a new skill each day. The members came up with amazing videos showcasing their talents with a diverse mix of tutorials. The team put together 52 acts in honor of Council 52. The club members also contributed by making one video together - 52 of us singing “I want it that way” by Backstreet Boys to involve everyone from the club.
