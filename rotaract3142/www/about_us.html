						<p>There are 1.2 million Rotarians in 34,000 clubs from all around the world. This network of clubs together makes the
							Rotary International. Clubs in a particular geographical area, are brought together under the title of a district.
							A district is led by the District Rotaract Representative (D.R.R.), who is further led supported by the District Governor.
							This geographical area is divided into 34 parts which consists of approximately 530 district.
							<strong> One such is the Rotaract district 3142. </strong>
